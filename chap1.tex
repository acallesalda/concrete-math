\section*{Exercise 2.}

Try visualizing for $1, 2, 3$ pegs, and you will get that 
$T_0 = 0, T_1 = 2, T_2 = 8$, and that the winning strategy 
is to transfer $n-1$ pegs to peg $B$ via peg $C$, which takes 
$T_{n-1}$ moves. Now, transfer the biggest peg to $C$, which takes
one move, and then trasnfer the $n-1$ pegs in $B$ to $A$, which takes 
$T_{n-1}$ moves. Transfer biggest from $C$ to $B$, taking one move, and 
transfer the other pegs to $B$, taking again $T_{n-1}$ moves, that is

\begin{align*}
    T_0 & = 0 \\
    T_{n} & = 3T_{n-1} + 2
\end{align*}

To solve this recurrence, we sum $1$ to each side (the idea here 
is that we want to factor $T_{n+1}$, and summing $1$ will make everything a 
factor of $3$), so we have 

\begin{align*}
    T_0 + 1 & = 1 \\
    T_{n} + 1 & = 3T_{n-1} + 3
\end{align*}

and letting $U_n = T_{n} + 1$, we get 

\begin{align*}
    U_0 & = 1 \\
    U_n & = 3U_{n-1}
\end{align*}

so clearly $U_n = 3^n$ and $T_n = 3^n - 1$. To prove that this is indeed the 
case, let's now use inducction. For $n=0$, $T_0 = 3^0 - 1 = 0$, and assume 
$T_{n-1} = 3^{n-1} - 1$, so 

\begin{equation*}
    T_n = 3T_{n-1} + 2 = 3(3^{n-1}-1) + 2 = 3^n - 3 + 2 = 3^n - 1
\end{equation*}

\section*{Exercise 10.}

I will describe the optimal strategies, which give rise to the relations between
$Q_n$, the number of turns taken to transfer $n$ disks from $A$ to $B$, and 
$R_n$, the number of turns taken to transfer from the $n$ disks from $B$ back 
to $A$, which are 

\begin{align*}
    Q_n & = 2R_{n-1}+1 \\
    R_n & = Q_n + Q_{n-1} + 1
\end{align*}

for $n > 0$. To get $Q_n$, we need to transfer the top $n-1$ pegs to from $A$
to $C$, which takes $R_{n-1}$ moves; then we transfr the last one to $B$, and then 
we move the top $n-1$ pegs from $C$ to $B$, taken $R_{n-1}$ turns again, i.e., 
$Q_n = 2R_{n-1} + 1$. 

To get $R_n$, we first move the $n-1$ smallest from $B$ to $A$, which takes $R_{n-1}$ turns,
then move the biggest peg to $C$, then move the $n-1$ smallest from $A$ to $B$, taking 
$Q_{n-1}$ turns, then move the biggest peg to $A$, and finally move the smallest 
$n-1$ pegs from $B$ to $A$, that is,

\begin{equation*}
    R_n = R_{n-1} + 1 + Q_{n-1} + 1 + R_{n-1} = 2R_{n-1} + 1 + Q_{n-1} + 1 = Q_n + Q_{n-1} + 1
\end{equation*}

which is what we wanted to show.
